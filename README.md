<h1 style="font-size:36px;">Housing Price Prediction</h1>

**Objective**

This project aims to predict housing prices based on various features of the houses using data analysis and predictive modeling techniques. The focus is on understanding the key factors that influence house prices and building an accurate prediction model.

**Key Steps**

- Data Import and Exploration:

- Import the dataset and understand the variables (features and target).

- Identify trends, correlations, and missing data.

- Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing:

- Handle missing values and outliers.

- Normalize and transform data for better model performance.

**Feature Engineering:**

- Select and engineer the most predictive features to enhance the model.

**Predictive Modeling:**

Build machine learning models to predict house prices.

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

**Tools and Technologies**
	- Programming Language: R (Quarto .qmd file)
	
 - Libraries: tidyverse, caret, ggplot2, and other data analysis packages


**File Structure**

Housing_Price.qmd: Quarto file containing the full analysis, data pre-processing, modeling, and evaluation steps.

**Results**

This project identifies the most important factors influencing house prices and provides an accurate model for predicting them. The insights can be used by stakeholders to make data-driven decisions in the real estate market.
